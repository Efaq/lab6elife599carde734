#' @details
#' This package is the solution for Lab 6 in Advanced R.
#' The package implements three solvers for the Knapsack problem (see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem}),
#' namely the Brute Force Search, the Dynamic Programming Solver and the Greedy Heuristic.
#' The Brute Force Search offers the possibility of using parallel computation.
#' Through the package's vignette you can learn about the differences in speed for these algorithms.
